## 🧠 Overview  
This project was created as part of the academic program at **Esprit School of Engineering**, within the context of exploring AI and smart agriculture solutions to enhance local industries. It aims to **predict the quality, variety, and water content of olive oil** using sensor data (fluorescence, e-nose, red lights) and **machine learning techniques**. This contributes to sustainable agriculture and better international competitiveness for Tunisian olive oil.

## 🌿 Features  
- Olive variety classification using sensor fusion  
- Quality assessment using **fluorescence and e-nose** readings  
- Estimation of water content in olive oil samples  
- Olive fruit counting on trees from video using deep learning  
- Focus on **sustainable farming** and **smart agriculture technologies**

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
### Backend / AI Models  
- **Python 3.10**  
- **scikit-learn**, **XGBoost**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow** , **PyTorch**
- **OpenCV** for video/image processing  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** for data handling
- **Web3**, **Express Js** for blockchain  

### Deployment Tools (optional)  
- GitHub Education tools: **Heroku**, **Namecheap**, **DigitalOcean** (planned)

### Other Tools  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  
- **Google Colab** for prototyping
